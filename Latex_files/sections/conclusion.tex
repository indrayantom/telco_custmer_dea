\section{Conclusion}
From all the results above it can be concluded that :
\begin{enumerate}
	\item In the last month, the company lost 1869 its customers, representing a churn rate of approximately 27\%. The main causes of customer churn are poor quality Fiber optic services and negative first-time customer experiences. As a result, nearly 42\% of Fiber optic users chose to churn in the last month, and more than 55\% of new customers (only subscribed for less than 4 months) chose to churn as well.
	\item Because the vast majority of customers (44\%) actually sign up for fiber optic service and pay such high monthly fees (around 70-120 dollars), the company should focus more on improving the quality in order to reduce its significant revenue loss. They should also improve the experience of their new customers and target those who are young or middle-aged, have a partner or dependents, as they are less likely to churn.
