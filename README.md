# âœ¨ Telco Customer Churn : Data Exploratory Analysis âœ¨ 
This work contains exploratory data analysis of Telco Customer Churn dataset, downloaded from Kaggle. The goal of this investigation is to uncover and provide information that will be useful to related businesses. This project is mainly done using Python and Google Collab. The documentation, on the other hand, was written in LaTeX.

## Objectives 
The customer base dataset used in this work is made available by IBM and downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn) . It is related to an anonymous telecom company and contains 7043 customers data with 21 attributes where each row represents a customer and each column contains customerâ€™s attributes.
The analysis is carried out to answer this problem :

- Who are the customers more likely to churn and what are the probable reasons behind that decision?
- What actions can be taken to prevent them from leaving?

## Libraries
Libraries such as [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [NumPy](https://numpy.org/), [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), and [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) are the most commonly used for the analysis. However, I also used [plotnine](https://plotnine.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to make a better (and easier) plots, as well as [PandasProfiling](https://pandas-profiling.github.io/pandas-profiling/docs/master/rtd/) to do some preliminary data analysis.
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.patches as mpatches
%config InlineBackend.figure_format = 'svg'
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')
from plotnine import *
from pandas_profiling import ProfileReport

## Result Preview
This stacked bar plot clearly shows the customers who have churned. First, the values of tenure and monthly charges were discretized/binned into 6 quantiles to create this stacked bar plot.

The result appears an instinctive result as the churn likelihood gets smaller as the membership time gets longer. It also tells that more than 50\% of customers who only subscribed less than 4 months prefer to churn (mostly even churn in their first month). From MonthlyCharges binning, it can be seen that the premium customers who are billed more than 70 dollars per month are more likely to churn compared to other customers with less bill. From the business perspective, it is surely more beneficial for the company to have a great focus improving on the premium services since those services have more lost customers and donate more month-to-month income for the company. Another interesting result is the customer who only subscribes for basic service seems quite satistied with the service quality and less likely to churn.
